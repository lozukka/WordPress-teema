I took a "How to develop a WordPress theme" -course at school. This is the outcome of that course.

What did I learn:
-The very basics of theme development
-I develop a very simple, basic theme
-I learned about WordPress hooks and actions
-I also learned about PHP and get to know how to code with PHP
